# Restaurant-Dasher
A VR game made in Unity where a player makes burgers based off the customer's order. 

## Overview
Restaurant Dasher VR is a first-person VR game built in Unity, designed to simulate a fast-paced restaurant environment. Players take customer orders, assemble burgers with multiple ingredients, and manage customer satisfaction under a time limit. This is my first VR game in which everything is made entirely by me!
