Welcome welcome you poor naive fool to the home of yours truly, Betty! Rules are simple doll, complete the customer's order, read the order bottom up, drop the ingredients off into that cute lil' chute right there. Make sure them patties get grilled but not charcoal burnt. Click the red button to clear the plate and the green to serve it. Remember, its 3 strikes and you're out. Good, done, got it, great? Great. Let the horror commence. Hehehe.
